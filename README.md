Project is to make a drone reach a target in a room.
The drone is controled using Q-Learning and getting the inputs out to transcribe them into
more human like inputs (such as : goLeft, forward, goDown, land...).

The main objective is for the drone to reach the exact location of the target, or at least to get
the closest possible to it.

Most important files are : main.py, dronecmds.py, best_episode_commands.py
