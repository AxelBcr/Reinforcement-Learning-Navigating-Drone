Just run main.py : 
  choose the room size (room_x, room_y, room_height), 
  target position (target_x, target_y, target_z), 
  drone position (drone_x, drone_y), 
  the number of episodes the AI should train,
  the max number of steps it can do during an episode

You will then see some plots (3D visu. of the trajectory, rewards graph) appear

Now just go to best_episode_commands.py, excecute it, start the simulation in the new window that appeared

Good job, you've done it, have fun with this code !
