For a single run :

  Just run main.py : 
    choose the room size (room_x, room_y, room_height), 
    target position (target_x, target_y, target_z), 
    drone position (drone_x, drone_y), 
    the number of episodes the AI should train,
    the max number of steps it can do during an episode
  
  You will then see some plots (3D visu. of the trajectory, rewards graph) appear
  
  Now just go to best_episode_commands.py, excecute it, start the simulation in the new window that appeared
  
  Good job, you've done it, have fun with this code !

For multiple runs with the ability to change target's coordinates:

    Run ChangingTarget.py :
      choose the room size (room_x, room_y, room_height), 
      target position (target_x, target_y, target_z), 
      drone position (drone_x, drone_y), 
      the number of episodes the AI should train,
      the max number of steps it can do during an episode

    A subprocess running the simulation will start :
      You can play the best_episode in this simulation

    Close the simulation when finished
    Then choose new coordinates for the target in the Python Command Prompt
    This will launch the simulation subprocess again with the new coordinates of the Target and last coordinates of the Drone
    You can now play the new best_episode for the new coordinates

    Close the process and choose if you want to rerun the training or not (y/n)
